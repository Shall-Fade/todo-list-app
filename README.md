## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Grid
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS Framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - Strongly Typed Programming Language
- [VUE](https://vuejs.org) - JS Framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - Frontend Tooling
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) - State Management Library

### What I learned

I learned how to use typescript with the vue framework and practiced working with TailwindCSS.

### Continued development

In the future, you need to:

- Add validation

## Conclusion

If you see any bugs in the code or want to share some advice, please contact me. I would be very grateful for any help or advice, as it will give me the opportunity to make fewer mistakes and improve my skills.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
